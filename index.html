			<p class="first"><span class="highlight">I</span>&#8217;ll never forget the red-headed woodpecker that graced us with its presence in 2012. It showed up like an apparition. Red-headeds stop me in my tracks, make me drop whatever I&#8217;m doing to watch them. And being bright, inquisitive, bold birds, they&#8217;re almost always doing something interesting.</p>

			<p>As I came up our driveway from an icy January run, I saw fresh boot prints in the snow and the words BIG NEWS written in a drift. I quickened my pace. I came up the sidewalk to find our daughter Phoebe still in her pajamas, clutching my camera with a 300mm telephoto lens, frantically waving me inside. &#8220;There&#8217;s a redheaded woodpecker at the feeder right now! Get in here!&#8221;</p>

			<p>She was the one who&#8217;d left the boot prints: she had run out to look for me; she was the one who&#8217;d scratched M. HURRY HOME and BIG NEWS in the snow on the driveway. And now she was following this vagrant apparition from window to window, frantically keeping tabs on him, willing me to get home before he flew away. She shoved the camera into my hands and pulled me to the kitchen window. You can&#8217;t buy a 15-year-old girl like that. You have to make them, with a healthy assist from luck and fate. She knows how to make her parents&#8217; hearts sing, and the best part is that it thrills her just as much.</p>

			<p id="video-trigger">There he was, just off the kitchen window in all his natty glory, pecking away at the peanut feeder. It was a little like seeing a unicorn in the garden. My hands shaking, I started shooting. Red-headed woodpeckers are vanishingly rare in Ohio now. A couple of pairs used to breed in a stand of giant oaks over a cow pasture about two miles from our home but have since deserted that place. We&#8217;ve had flyovers every year in September, October, and May, most of them spotted from the bird-watching tower atop our home. Only one other red-headed woodpecker has landed in our yard in 20 years. That one ate corn for a morning and was gone before Bill got home from work. I&#8217;ve never forgotten that bird, that lost chance to share its miraculous beauty.</p>

			<p>Over the next seven hours, that woodpecker tried everything we had. He contemplated suet; he tried black-oil sunflower but seemed not to know how to open the seeds. He ate peanuts from our peanut feeder and cached several in the bark of a dead tree. While he sat in our sycamore, I moved quietly out and replenished the Zick Dough in our birch log feeder, leaving conspicuous piles on the deck railing, too. He watched me. And not five minutes later he was tasting what I&#8217;m sure was his first bill-full of homemade manna. From then on, he bopped between roasted cocktail peanuts, whole corn, and Zick Dough, storing quantities of both in the dead tree&#8217;s bark. It was magic. I&#8217;ll confess I was doing everything in my power to get him hooked. Here. Eat this. And this, and this. Don&#8217;t worry. There&#8217;s more.</p>

			<p>He was nasty to all the other birds, something I found oddly endearing. This newcomer&#8212;this <i>rara </i>avis&#8212;acted as if he owned the place. I was ready to sign the title over. The kids were enthralled, running from window to window to watch him. I was beside myself. How could this happen again, with Bill away? Needless to say, we fell completely in love with Garrett, as Phoebe named him, and the feeling seemed mutual. (We couldn&#8217;t be sure of the bird&#8217;s sex; sexes are indistinguishable in 

			<p>To our delight, Garrett stayed for a little over two weeks! Bill not only got to see him, but also to photograph him for an extended period. Every time I saw him, my heart leapt. Something about his combination of colors made my happy neurons fire. So bright, so cleanly marked, so outlandishly unexpected among the grays, browns, olives, and occasional blues of winter. I always thought someone had left a toy on the deck railing when I saw him on it, one of those stuffed woodpeckers that squawks when you squeeze it.</p>

			<p>By the second night of Garrett&#8217;s stay, I began to worry where he would sleep. That question was swiftly answered when he flew to a broken birch stub just off the back corner of the house and forced his way into a downy woodpecker hole halfway up the snag. This was one of the first gray birches we planted upon moving here in 1992. Because they are birches and host to seemingly every insect and disease around, they&#8217;re dead now. But we did not cut them down. We planted more and let these naturally deliquesce.</p>

			<p>I was not the only one who noticed him going into the cavity. Three Carolina chickadees began scolding like mad, their <i>dee dee dees </i>reaching a crescendo each time Garrett&#8217;s head popped out of the hole. Perhaps the night roost had changed hands and was now chickadee property. Garrett&#8217;s crimson head popped in and out of the hole as he excavated and spat birch chips out over and over. Tough tits, chickadees. This is my bedroom now, he seemed to say.</p>

			<h2>Garrett shows his yellow belly.</h2>

			<p id="bird-trigger">From then on, Garrett spent a good portion of his day perched just outside his roost hole, staring into his boudoir. He clearly felt welcome in our yard. And it was a good thing he did, because one stormy day his birch snag broke off right at the bedroom. As soon as I saw it lying on the ground, I rummaged in the garage for a woodpecker roost box. Hurriedly, I bungeed it onto a nearby birch, and as soon as it was up, Garrett was on it, peering inside. I grinned broadly, until I noticed that he couldn&#8217;t push in past his broad shoulders. He began to peck at the opening, but pecking through the hard cedar was slow going, and the afternoon was waning. I dragged the box down and took a chisel and file to the hole, laboriously enlarging it to 2 1/8 inches. By then, darkness had fallen, and Garrett spent a rainy night out. When he appeared the next morning, he was soaked to the skin, and sitting on the roost box, which I&#8217;d filled with hamster litter. To our joy, he disappeared inside the box, and emerged with a bill full of litter. Ptoo! he shook his head, and soon the ground beneath the box was covered with litter. Garrett would roost in his box for the remainder of his stay. I hoped he&#8217;d stay forever.</p>

			<p>On the morning of January 30, 2012, I went for my run. It was a pearly morning with promise of a little sun. I came up the driveway toward home around 8:45 a.m. Garrett flew out to meet me. I couldn&#8217;t believe he was flying on a straight line toward me. He perched in the old pear tree right over my head, holding a peanut in his bill. I spoke to him and told him what a fine, fine bird he was, and how glad I was to see him. I thanked him for coming out to say hello. I told him I&#8217;d enjoyed having him here since the 15th of January and I hoped he liked all the things we&#8217;d done to make him feel welcome. He bobbed a couple of times and flew to the southeast, landing briefly in a willow. I headed up the sidewalk to start my morning, musing about how odd it was that he&#8217;d fly up to me, perch right over my head, stop to chat. That was the last time I saw Garrett in our yard. All day long, I told myself I just wasn&#8217;t looking in the right places at the right time. By 3 p.m., I knew that Garrett had flown straight to me to say goodbye. And, maybe, thank you. It was then that the tears came.</p>

			<p>But, as with all bird stories, it wasn&#8217;t really over. For Garrett, in a move whose wisdom was known only to him, took up residence in our neighbor&#8217;s yard a half-mile away, whose occasional feeder offerings consisted of grocery-store mixed seed. I saw him there for the first time on February 8 and almost daily thereafter. And Garrett, in his grace and seeming wit, would fly out to meet me most mornings as I ran along the road, landing in a mulberry right over my head. I&#8217;d laugh out loud to see him, at his beauty and the bizarre connection we shared. It was clear that he had come to associate me with good things: artisan bird foods, roost boxes. I took to sneaking into my neighbor&#8217;s yard, quietly stocking his feeder with cocktail peanuts, whole corn, and Zick Dough. Nothing was good enough for my Garrett. Garrett stayed there until April 18, when he (or she) took off to find other red-headeds. He&#8217;d lit up my winter, given me hundreds of photos to treasure, and taught me volumes about the intelligence, adaptability, and confiding nature of my favorite woodpecker. One bird, closely observed, a treasure trove of quirky behavior and insight.</p>

			<p id="play-trigger">Why was it such a big deal to me to have a red-headed woodpecker in my yard? Well, in Southeast Ohio, they&#8217;re vanishing. A perusal of literature reveals that red-headed woodpeckers have always been subject to population peaks and crashes. They are sensitive to variations in annual mast (acorn) production by the oaks they favor, which affects their survival over the winter. Historically, the ravages of Dutch elm disease and American chestnut blight created a temporary windfall of dead trees for excavation and foraging. Breeding populations in southern Illinois increased 28-fold, and wintering birds increased 58-fold at the peak abundance of dead elms in the early 1980s, only to crash when the trees fell. The mysterious extinction of the Rocky Mountain grasshopper, a favorite prey item, contributed to declines in the West and Midwest.</p>

			<p>Even the onset of automobiles has been cited as a negative pressure on these birds, which are often hit as they pick insects off roadways. My Iowa-born father always asserted that speeding cars caused their decline in Iowa, so finding his observations borne out in the literature gave me a wistful smile. More disturbing are the noncyclic declines red-headed woodpeckers continue to display throughout their range. For the 30 years leading up to 1996, breeding bird surveys indicated a 2.2 percent decline annually. Ironically, the Ohio Hills suffered a 16.1 percent decline annually during this period, a figure that saddens but does not surprise me. I know of only one site in my Southeast Ohio county&#8212;a rest stop with massive oak trees&#8212;where I can reliably find these wonderful woodpeckers.</p>

			<p>It seems clear that having abundant standing dead trees for nesting cavities as well as a reliable supply of mature oaks for acorns are the two key factors in red-headed abundance. These birds need large, widely spaced trees with an open, grassy understory, a habitat type that has become exceedingly rare. Parks, old fairgrounds, and village greens supply small patches of such habitat, but standing dead trees are all too often taken down, being viewed as hazardous. Beavers, as they have increased in the northeastern forests, have given red-headed woodpeckers a much-needed boost, flooding wooded areas and creating the standing dead snags the birds love.</p>

			<p>In my mid- to late-summer paddles, I&#8217;ve been careful to document the foods I see red-headeds catching and carrying. Their primary prey at West Virginia&#8217;s North Bend State Park is dog day cicadas. Not many birds are equipped to process such large, strong insects, and I enjoy watching red-heads snatch them in the air, then take them to a large limb for smashing, de-winging and de-legging. Red-headeds are the most heavily insectivorous of all North American woodpeckers, and along with their western cousins the Lewis&#8217; woodpeckers, are most likely to sally out into the air in pursuit of flying insects. The open canopy and understory of their preferred habitat, studded with dead snags, provides hunting perches and the long sightlines these birds need to capture flying prey.</p>

			<p>For such a gaudy bird, little is known about the red-headed&#8217;s breeding biology. High, inaccessible nest sites may be part of the reason. Amazingly, no information exists on growth and development of the young&#8212;something I&#8217;m itching to correct. We know that both sexes incubate the eggs for 12 to 14 days, and young are in the nest for a long period: 27 to 31 days. I&#8217;ve observed double brooding at North Bend State Park, with young still in the nest in late August and flying but still being fed in early September. Fledged young have distinctive, striped brown heads and military-smart black bars across the tertials.</p>

			<p>Because they are largely dependent on insects, most red-headeds clear out of their northern range with the onset of cold weather, migrating in September to warmer reaches of the southern United States. Their migration might be characterized as erratic and even nomadic, and they may arrive on northern breeding grounds as early as March or as late as May.</p>

			<p>From our bird-watching tower, we look for the red-headed&#8217;s twinkling white wings amid flocks of blue jays passing over in September and listen for their high, hysterical <i>queerk</i>! and annoyed-sounding <i>kwerr </i>calls in the spring. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll ever again be blessed with an overwintering red-headed, but we stand ready to provide room and abundant board to one should it appear. I count our experience with Garrett among the most satisfying interactions I&#8217;ve had with a wild bird. He seemed to grasp that I was trying to accommodate him with my offerings, many and varied. He&#8217;d fly a few yards to a nearby sycamore and watch intently as I deposited a new food on the deck railing. As soon as I was back inside, he&#8217;d whirl to the railing in a pinwheel of red, black and white to try the new treat. When his roost snag broke off, he watched me mount and modify a roost box for him and moved right in the next day. All birds should be as appreciative and deeply appreciated.</p>

			<p>I have a dear friend who has seen a red-headed woodpecker once, on a dead tree not far from her farm in Guysville, Ohio. Mimi says that, all these years later, she still goes to visit the tree, hoping there might be one clinging there again.</p>

			<p>This summer, I&#8217;m going to take Mimi to North Bend State Park and show her a few red-headed woodpeckers. Maybe 70.</p>

			<h2>Feeding Behavior</h2>

			<p class="first">The most heavily insectivorous of all North American woodpeckers, red- heads sally out from exposed dead limbs to snag cicadas, dragonflies, beetles, and other large fly- ing insects on the wing. They are not as prone to excavating for beetle larvae as the red-bellied, hairy, and downy, preferring to forage for nuts and fruits to supplement their flycatching. Being fond of crickets and grasshoppers, red- headeds may dive to the ground from low perches in the manner of bluebirds.</p>

			<p>They are also frequent nest pirates, helping themselves to eggs and nestlings of other birds and sometimes destroying nests in their territories.</p>

			<h2>When and Where to Look</h2>

			<p class="first">Red-headed woodpeckers are strongly migratory in the northern part of their range, which includes the eastern two-thirds of the United States, from central Montana east to western Vermont, and sparingly south to southern Florida. They may winter in any part of their breeding range or go as far south as central Texas and the Gulf Coast. Redheaded woodpeckers find their center of abundance in the upper Midwest, where they are easier to find in open groves and windbreaks with large oaks.</p>

			<p id="map-trigger">They prefer widely spaced mature oaks and hickories in an open, grassy understory. Pastureland, parks, even fairgrounds and town greens may provide this habitat. Look and listen in beaver swamps and any- where large numbers of standing dead trees are present.</p>

			</div>

			<h2>What to Look and Listen For</h2>

			<p class="first">It’s hard to miss the brilliant, clean colors of the 9-inch- long red-headed woodpeckers, with their unique all-red heads, black backs, and clean white secondary wing patches and underparts. In flight, the wings have a twinkle that can be seen at a great distance. Sexes are alike, perhaps because female birds are involved in nest defense as well as males.</p>

			<p>Immature birds keep a brown-striped head through their first fall and winter and show black stripes on the white hindwings.</p>

			<p>Listen for the redhead’s high, slightly hysterical-sounding queerk! and their angry-sounding churring kwerr kwerr kwerr call, often given in flight. These birds are noisy and active, and though they may sit still for long periods, they don’t stay hidden long. They drum a great deal in breeding season, sounding a rapid tattoo on resonant limbs.</p>
